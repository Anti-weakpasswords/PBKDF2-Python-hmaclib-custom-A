PBKDF2 for Python

Works with at least Python 2.7 on Linux, and PyInstaller can turn it into a Windows executable.

Unlike bcrypt this is easy to understand, secure enough given a cryptographically
random salt and implemented on top of the stdlib in about 20 lines of code.
Also easy to understand and analyze.

Tests included.

Happy hashing.
